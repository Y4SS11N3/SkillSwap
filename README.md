## Project Overview

As my final project in the ALX Software Engineering program, I developed SkillSwap to demonstrate proficiency in full-stack development, database management, and real-time communication implementation. This project embodies the core principles of software engineering I've learned throughout the program and showcases my ability to bring a complex application from concept to completion.

## Features

- User authentication and profile management
- Skill listing and categorization
- Skill exchange request system
- Real-time chat functionality
- Video meeting integration using Jitsi
- Dashboard with skill statistics and recent exchanges

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js
- PostgreSQL
- Sequelize ORM
- Socket.io for real-time communication
- JWT for authentication

### Frontend
- React.js
- Redux for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Axios for API requests
- Socket.io-client for real-time features

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- PostgreSQL
- npm or yarn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Y4SS11N3/SkillSwap.git
cd skillswap
```

2. Install backend dependencies:

```
cd backend
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
   * Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your details

4. Set up the database:

```
npx sequelize-cli db:create
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```

5. (Optional) Seed the database with demo data:

```
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
```

6. Install frontend dependencies:

```
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

7. Set up frontend environment variables:
   * Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust as needed

## Usage

1. Start the backend server:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend development server:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Future Enhancements

- Implement a rating system for skill exchanges
- Add a recommendation engine for skill matches
- Integrate a calendar for scheduling skill exchange sessions
